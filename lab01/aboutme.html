            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m from Nepal and have a passion for technology, storytelling, and entertainment.
                 I enjoy watching movies, especially Hollywood films and anime, as well as playing games with my brothers back home,
                 which brings a sense of nostalgia. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer. In my free time, 
                 I like writing fictional stories and exploring new coding challenges. I’ve completed CS50x and CS50W,
                  finished a Python course on Udemy, and have completed about 50% of The Odin Project.
